#### Ideas
1. Use a C++ implementation of PCA on all frames. Use `boost` to bootstrap that implementation to Python. Use an optional argument to recruit PCA or not, so we can write checkpoints of each. Perhaps the base path changes as `pca` and/or `raw`.
2. rcParams for final plot
3. Updated README
4. Add docstrings to all classes
